# Week of April 14th

This week I worked on drawing the tiles both in terms of the graphics and with drawing them on the screen. I also created a main character
and added the ability to move it from tile to tile with arrow keys.

I've been struggling a lot with making certain tiles not able to be walked through. I will make sure to finish that soon.
