# CS 126 FinalProject

### About
This is a short role playing game from the perspective of a CS Boiâ„¢ whose duty is to navigate through the harsh realities of the 
CS building, Siebel, in order to impress his peers and to find a Girl. It is up to you, the player, to make the right decisions and 
maximize your character's charisma and romance levels.

There's only two rooms in the game right now. However, it gives a general sense of what the full game would have been like.
